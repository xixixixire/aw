Hybrid net: the regulatory
framework of ICANN and

the DNS

Emily M. Weitzenboeck*

Abstract
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is
responsible for the management and coordination of the internet domain
name and address space, which are critical resources necessary for internet

connectivity. Though international in reach since it cooperates with per-
sons, organizations and governments in many countries, ICANN was set up

as a private non-profit organization under California law. This article exam-
ines the role, legal nature and basis of ICANN and the domain name

system (DNS). It first maps and analyses the various regulatory instruments
underlying ICANN and the DNS. What emerges is that, very often several
and different modes of regulation, both formal and informal, are required
to address a particular issue satisfactorily. The article examines whether and
to what extent these different types of instruments co-exist and interrelate
as one coherent regulatory framework. To do so, this article draws upon
Teubner’s notion of hybrid networks and makes an analogy with modern

theories on how various sources of law apply within a legal system. In par-
ticular, it follows and builds upon Ost and van de Kerchove’s notion of

network or ‘mesh’ regulation. To explain the contractual web at the heart

1. Introduction: ICANN and the DNS
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is

one of the governors of the internet.1 It is tasked with ‘inter alia’ the man-
agement and coordination of the Domain Name System (DNS) and,

through its so-called IANA functions,2 it is responsible for the root zone
management for the DNS and the global coordination of the Internet
Protocol (IP) address space. As DeNardis explains, the internet domain

name space and the internet address space are ‘critical’ resources for inter-
net connectivity, with the DNS ‘translating between alphanumeric domain

names and their associated numerical IP addresses necessary for routing
information across the Internet’.3
In view of the critical nature of these resources, the role, legal nature and
basis of the organization tasked with their management and co-ordination—
ICANN—is significant. ICANN is a private law organization set up in 1998 as
a non-profit public benefit corporation under Californian law. It is not an
international organization set up under public international law. However, it
is international in the sense that its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
mandate cooperation with organizations and persons in many countries as
well as governments.4 ICANN is a creature of private law although it was
originally set up by an agreement with the US Department of Commerce
(DOC). Yet the picture is more complex than that. As this article shows, an
elaborate web of contracts and more informal documents underlie ICANN’s

set-up and the relations with the various private entities and national autho-
rities with which it deals. This complexity extends to the regulation of the

DNS where a variety of regulatory instruments—contractual and statutory,
formal and informal, legal and non-legal—are used.
One question that arises is how do these various instruments operate
together. Another question is whether they can be read together as a

Authority (IANA). See further LA Bygrave and T Michaelsen, ‘Governors of the Internet’ in LA Bygrave and J

coherent legal framework. To answer these questions, this article draws an
analogy with modern theories on how various sources of law apply within a
legal system. In particular, it builds upon Ost and van de Kerchove’s notion
of network or ‘mesh’ regulation.5 In order to do this, the main regulatory

instruments of ICANN and the DNS are first identified. In order to under-
stand the private ordering of ICANN, it bears highlighting that it is not

enough to examine the corporation’s formal organization as a private law
foundation under Californian law; account must also be taken of its external
relations with private actors such as registrars and registries as well as various

public law actors such as the US government and the many national autho-
rities with whom an elaborate network of formal and informal arrangements

has gradually been built.6 Indeed, ICANN’s regulatory framework has been
described as an example of ‘self-constitutionalization without a state’.7
To understand the role, legal nature and basis of ICANN, this article starts
by mapping and analysing the various regulatory instruments underlying it
(Section 2) and the DNS which it is tasked to co-ordinate (Section 3). The

type of instrument used and the extent to which it is binding is also exam-
ined. To explain the contractual web at the heart of the gTLD namespace,

Cafaggi’s notion of contractual networks is utilized.8 The article then dis-
cusses the question of whether and to what extent these different types of

instruments co-exist and interrelate as one coherent regulatory framework.
It does so by drawing first upon Teubner’s notion of hybrid networks
(Section 4) and then upon Ost and van de Kerchove’s theory of network
or mesh regulation (Section 5).
2. The first strands of the net: legal basis and
structure of ICANN
An intricate web of contracts and more informal agreements underlie
ICANN’s set-up and the relations with the various entities with which it
deals. Put briefly,9 ICANN was set up in response to a call by the US DOC
for a new entity to assume the primary responsibility for the management of
internet names and addresses.10 This was done through a Memorandum of

Understanding (MOU) between ICANN and the DOC which was subse-
quently amended six times, replaced by a Joint Project Agreement in 2006

and, upon its expiry, by an Affirmation of Commitments (AOC) in 2009.

THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF ICANN AND THE DNS

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ijlit/article/22/1/49/697798 by guest on 14 April 2023

The judicial enforceability of the AOC has been described as dubious with at
least two scholars claiming that it is probably not a valid contract.11
Besides the AOC, the legal basis of the ICANN–DOC relationship today
rests on another agreement: that for the performance of the IANA functions
described earlier. ICANN took over the IANA functions from the University
of Southern California (USC), which had been operating IANA as a research
project, through a so-called ‘Transition Agreement’ between ICANN and
the USC in 1998.12 It should be noted that originally, there was a third
agreement on which the legal basis of ICANN–DOC rested, namely, the

Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) on the secur-
ity and robustness of the DNS root server,—which agreement has since

lapsed.13
Another document worth noting is the MOU Concerning the Technical
Work of IANA between ICANN and the IETF signed on 1 March 2000 and
since supplemented by several Supplement Agreements. The IETF is the

principal body engaged in the development of new internet standard spe-
cifications. The status of the MOU may at first appear unclear as it seems to

lay down obligations solely for IANA/ICANN, raising the doubt whether it is
a valid contract since there is no element of exchange.14 However, a closer
reading of Section 4.1 reveals that for IANA to assign and register the IPs and
parameters, it needs to follow the criteria and procedures of the documents
drawn up and specified by the IETF (RFCs,15 Proposed and Internet
Standards, etc). That section leaves open the possibility for the development
(by the IETF) of further criteria and procedures to be adopted by IANA

when so instructed by the Internet Engineering Steering Group, a manage-
ment committee of the IETF. The argument could thus be made that for

IANA to continue performing its undertakings in Section 4.1, the IETF must
continue with the production of standards and the development of any

missing criteria and procedures over time. In fact, the subsequent supple-
mental agreements specifically and, very often, in meticulous detail, specify

other criteria and procedures that were since developed by IANA and the
IETF. The element of consideration is thus present and the MOU is a valid
contract.
11 Froomkin claims the AOC is probably not a valid contract because of lack of consideration. See AM
Froomkin, ‘Almost free: An analysis of ICANN’s “Affirmation of Commitments”’ (2011) 9 JTHTL 187, 199–
203. Bygrave queries this claim but notes other problems with the AOC, namely (i) the lack of clear statutory
authority enabling the DOC to bind itself and (ii) the AOC’s ‘probable lack of mutual enforceability given the
vagueness of much of what each party promises’. See LA Bygrave, ‘Contract Versus Statute in Internet
Governance’ in I Brown (ed), Research Handbook on Governance of the Internet (Edward Elgar Publishing 2013)
168, 176–77. 12 See <http://www.icann.org/en/about/agreements/usc-icann-transition>. 13 See art 11.11 which linked the duration of CRADA to the terms of the Statement of Work which lapsed on
30 June 2002. See ‘Amendment 2’ at <http://www.icann.org/en/about/agreements>. 14 In common law, a promise will not be enforceable unless it is supported by consideration. Thus, for a
promise (offer) to be legally binding, it must seek something (or some action) in return (quid pro quo). 15 A Request for Comments (RFC) is a document which describes technical or organizational information
about the internet, and include the technical specifications and policy documents produced by the IETF.

Though ICANN’s ties with the US government are due to the history of
the internet—the internet was after all born in the USA and that is also
where the DNS was first devised16—the links with the USA are more than
just historical. The first three aforementioned legal documents require
ICANN to maintain the control of its operations physically in the USA.

CRADA gave the DOC the right to terminate the contract if ‘direct or indir-
ect control’ of ICANN was ‘transferred to a foreign company or govern-
ment’.17 The latest IANA Contract18 goes even further and requires that

ICANN shall be a wholly US-owned firm operating, incorporated and orga-
nized under US law. It also specifies that the primary IANA functions are to

be performed in the USA, and that ICANN, as contractor, shall maintain,
throughout the performance of the contract, a physical address in the USA.
Moreover, all primary obligations and systems must remain within the
USA.19 Similarly, in the AOC, one of ICANN’s affirmations is to remain a
non-profit corporation headquartered in the USA though the same clause
also seeks to counteract the impact of this by stating that ‘ICANN is a private
organization and nothing in this Affirmation should be construed as control

by any one entity’.20 Through these provisions, I would argue, the US gov-
ernment wants to ensure that it maintains jurisdictional control and, more

importantly, enforcement ability over ICANN. In other words, the fact that
ICANN has a physical presence and carries out its main business operations
in the USA in effect means that the DOC may easily take action through the
US court system and enforce any court judgment or injunctions on ICANN.
Besides the abovementioned four documents, there are also ICANN’s
constitutive documents, that is, ICANN’s Articles of Incorporation and its
Bylaws. These two documents were attached to the original MOU between
ICANN and the DOC and also the AOC, though the Bylaws have been

amended since then.21 The Bylaws contain detailed rules on ICANN’s mis-
sion and core values and the composition of its Board. They also set up the

various supporting organizations such as the country-code names support-
ing organization (ccNSO), the generic name supporting organization

(GNSO), advisory committees and the nominating committee.
ICANN’s key internal documents also include two soft-law instruments:
ICANN’s Code of Conduct for voting and non-voting Board members, as

the IANA Functions Contract in Internet Governance’ in this volume. 19 See Clause C.2.1. 20 See, in particular, Affirmation 8(b). 21 The latest amendment to the Bylaws was on 11 April 2013. See <http://www.icann.org/en/about/gov

well as ICANN’s Conflict of Interest Policy.22 The latter is directed at officers,
directors, board liaison and key employees of ICANN.
3. Further strands: structure of the DNS
3.1 – The domain namespace

As stated in the introduction, within ICANN’s IANA remit is the coordin-
ation of the DNS with the main objective being to ensure that every internet

address is unique and that the users of the internet can find all valid
addresses. A domain name is a unique identifier for an IP address or
number in a mnemonic form. There are two categories of top-level
domain names: generic top-level domains (gTLDs)23 and the set of two

letter country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). The initial general frame-
work of the DNS system structure and delegation was documented by Jon

Postel in RFC 1591.24 Since May 1999, ICANN/IANA follows ICP-1: Internet
DNS Structure and Delegation which lays down IANA’s current practices in
administering ‘inter alia’ RFC 1591.
With the opening of the top-level domain in the new gTLD program, 1930
applications for new gTLDs were filed in spring 2012. Since November 2009,
ccTLDs may apply for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) in scripts
other than US-ASCII.25 The new gTLD program also allows for the first time
the addition of IDN gTLDs into the root zone.26
3.2 – Contractual network of the gTLD namespace
Governance of the gTLD namespace is contractual, with a web of contracts

spun between, respectively, ICANN, registries, registrars, data escrow pro-
viders and eventually between the registrants and the registrars with which

they deal. The management of the ccTLD varies with some countries having
opted for a formal contractual arrangement with ICANN while others have
preferred an informal arrangement. Some countries also have statutory
regulation of their ccTLD. The regulatory framework of the gTLD and
the ccTLD namespace are examined in more detail in this section and
the next.

22 These are available at, respectively, <http://www.icann.org/en/groups/board/governance/code-of-
conduct> and <http://www.icann.org/en/news/announcements/announcement-2-15may12-en.htm>. 23 As at 8 October 2013, there are 60 in ASCII (the American Standard Code for Information Interchange—

ASCII—is a character-encoding scheme originally based on the English alphabet). See <http://www.icann.

between registries and registrars will thus be possible under the new gTLD
regime.30
In addition, the ICANN-RA contains, ‘inter alia’, as an appendix: (i) a
standard draft of a Zone File Access Agreement that a Registry must enter
into with any third-party requesting zone file access; and (ii) a service-level
agreement or a description of the functional and performance specifications
which the Registry undertakes to uphold. Registries for gTLDs maintain
DNS zone files that contain resource records for the domain names that
are active within those gTLDs.
There is not merely a ‘web of contracts’ in the sense of a set of loosely
related contracts between various actors (such as registries, registrars, escrow
providers) and ICANN to regulate the gTLD namespace. Some parts of this
web actually form a ‘contractual network’. As Cafaggi observes, ‘it is not
sufficient to have a multiplicity of linked contracts for a contractual network
to emerge’.31 More is required:
there has to be (1) a strong collective interest to pursue (2) a common
objective, and (3) a high level of interdependence among the contracts
and the activities performed through contracts.32

One utility of contractual network theory is that it helps elucidate how con-
tracts are interlinked and hence, whether and the extent to which one can

make cross-references between such contracts to assist in their interpret-
ation. Another utility is that it helps address doctrinal difficulties created

by the notion of privity of contract33 or, as it is known in civil law jurisdictions,
the relativity of contracts.34 The doctrine of privity appears to be a major
stumbling block to recognizing rights for parties in other linked contracts
but who are, technically speaking, extraneous to the bilateral contract that
has been breached. A typical example of such an extraneous party would be
the registrant vis-a`-vis an ICANN-RA.
In effect, the backbone of the DNS is made up of a set of interdependent,
bilateral linked contracts. With respect to each respective gTLD, due to the
30Current gTLD registry agreements prohibit registries from acquiring directly or indirectly more than 15%
of a registrar—see ‘New gTLD Program Explanatory Memorandum: Registry-Registrar Separation’ of February
2009, ch 2 at <https://archive.icann.org/en/topics/new-gtlds/regy-regr-separation-18feb09-en.pdf>. 31 F Cafaggi, ‘Contractual Networks and Contract Theory: A Research Agenda for European Contract Law’
in F Cafaggi (ed) Contractual Networks, Inter-firm Cooperation and Economic Growth (Edward Elgar 2011) 66, 74. 32 Cafaggi (n 31) 74. 33 Briefly stated, contractual privity means that contracts are binding only between the parties thereto and
cannot be enforced either by or against third parties. However, the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999
introduced an exception to this doctrine in English law such that a third party may acquire enforceable rights
under a contract if, and to the extent that, the parties to the contract so intend. See HG Beale (gen ed), Chitty on
Contracts - Vol 1: General Principles (including 3rd cumulative supplement of 2011, 30th edn, Sweet & Maxwell
2008) para 18–001. Similarly, most civil-law jurisdictions recognize so-called contracts for the benefit of a third
party. See eg BS Markesinis, H Unberath and A Johnston, The German Law of Contract: A Comparative Treatise
(2nd edn, Hart Publishing 2006) 186–203. 34 See eg art 1165, French Civil Code. This is also the main rule in Norway – see Rt 1997 p 1322 referred in G
Woxholth, Avtalerett (8th edn, Gyldendal Akademisk 2012) 167.

tree-like structure of the DNS, there is a vertical linked contractual network
between the ICANN-RA, RRA and the registration agreement between the
registrar and registrant as Figure 1 shows.
However, the contractual network is more complex than this, with at

least35 two other sub-networks linked to the vertical bilaterally-linked con-
tractual network:

(i) The contractual network between ICANN, the registry and the escrow
agent which comprises the ICANN-RA and ICANN’s third-party
registry data escrow agreement (Figure 2).
(ii) A mirror contractual network to that in (i) above between ICANN,
the registrar and the escrow agent (Figure 3).

complex contractual network is observed between ICANN, the Registry,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent contractual network. Besides the RA,

the RAA and the two escrow agreements, Figure 4 also shows another agree-

high level of interdependence, are met in the case of each respective gTLD.
There is a strong collective interest of all the various contractual parties to
pursue the common objective of regulating and operating the respective
gTLD in a manner which works, observing the tree-like structure of the TLD
(here the relevant parties are ICANN, the registry, the registrar and the
registrant) and ensuring security of the registration data (here the relevant
parties are ICANN, the registry, the registrar and the third-party escrow
agent). To achieve (i) and (ii) aforementioned, there is a high level of
interdependence between the various contracts and the activities performed
under such contracts, as discussed above and as Figures 1–4 illustrate. The
existence of these contractual networks in Cafaggi’s sense implies that
the contracts forming a contractual network could be read together to
give coherence to the underlying legal framework such as, for example, to
understand the extent of a party’s obligations.
Moreover, a strong argument can be made that there is also a contractual
network for the entire gTLD namespace or, perhaps more precisely, there
are two contractual webs: (i) the contractual web for the gTLDs issued under

the old system (ie not including the new gTLD program), and (ii) the con-
tractual web for the new gTLDs under the new program. This makes for a

multifaceted regulatory structure. However, it also highlights the significant
help that contractual network theory as proposed by Cafaggi provides in
trying to seek coherence in this web.
From the above it is clear that the preferred regulatory tool for the gTLD
namespace is contract. This massive reliance on contract, with ICANN being
the focal node of the network, shows the growing influence of ICANN as the
principal and dominant actor in the regulation of the gTLD namespace.
ICANN is indeed the protagonist here: it is the main drafter of the regulatory
mechanisms, that is, of the various contracts used in this web. Not only that,

but also all of the other actors—whether offering services in the gTLD name-
space (eg registries, registrars) or wanting to register a gTLD (ie regis-
trants)—do not have much option but to accept such terms with little

leeway, if any, should they want to operate in the gTLD namespace.
3.3 – The ccTLD namespace
Historically the delegation of ccTLDs has been informal, with several
ccTLDs delegated by Jon Postel without any formal agreement. ICANN
has formalized relationships with a few ccTLD managers (eg .au, .jp and
.ke) through formal ‘Sponsorship Agreements’.
After considering the ‘Guidelines for ccTLD managers Accountability
Framework discussions with ICANN’ developed by the ccNSO, ICANN has
sought to document its existing relationship with ccTLDs through the use of
either of two mechanisms, in the absence of a formal agreement.36 One

THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF ICANN AND THE DNS

option is an Accountability Framework document which not only contains
clauses stating the obligations of a ccTLD manager and ICANN, but is also
meant to cover dispute resolution and termination. It was designed ‘to cater
to those ccTLD managers who require a more “formal” document with

ICANN’.37 In actual fact, although it is also meant to cover dispute reso-
lution, some of the ccTLDs chose not to include such a clause in their

Accountability Framework.38
The other option is the use of an exchange of letters which has even less

formal language than the Accountability Framework. The legal enforceabil-
ity of such letters is dubious, to say the least. In fact, several exchanges of

letters contain a clause stating that the letters ‘will not form the basis for any
claim for any legal or equitable relief, or create reliance on the part of either
party’ and that ‘nothing contained in this letter shall give rise to any liability,
monetary or otherwise’ by one party towards the other. Such clauses appear,
for example, in the exchange of letters between ICANN and the ccTLD
manager of, respectively, Norway, the UK, Luxembourg, Austria and
Brazil.39 Other countries have variants of this clause but the main thrust of
such exchange of letters seems to be their declaratory and informal nature.

Clauses like the abovementioned make it clear that the parties have no in-
tention to be legally bound and hence such letters are not contractually

binding.40
Though not as informal as the exchange of letters, the legal bite of the
Accountability Framework is rather weak as it also contains, as one of its
standard clauses a ‘no monetary liability’ clause similar to the one found
in the exchange of letters. Moreover, as abovementioned, in the case of

countries that have opted out of having a dispute resolution clause,41 a fur-
ther clause was added to emphasize that it was not the intention of the

parties to use litigation as a form of dispute resolution and that the parties
are to use their best endeavours to resolve any dispute.
Many ccTLD managers have opted for either of the abovementioned two
informal mechanisms. This is evidence of their reluctance to have a formal,
legally binding contract with ICANN regarding their management of the
ccTLD. What most ccTLD managers embrace, though, is the principle of
subsidiarity. The White Paper recognized the role that national governments
have in ‘manag[ing] or establish[ing] policy for their own ccTLDs’.42 This
principle was incorporated in both the ICANN’s MOU with the DOC and in

Policy 1)43 and the ‘Principles and guidelines for the delegation and admin-
istration of country code top level domains’ adopted by the Governmental

Advisory Committee (GAC) for ICANN. The latter principles state that:
... ccTLD policy should be set locally, unless it can be shown that the
issue has global impact and needs to be resolved in an international
framework. Most of the ccTLD policy issues are local in nature and

should therefore be addressed by the local Internet Community, accord-
ing to national law.44 (Article 1.2)

This principle of subsidiarity has been transposed, practically ‘verbatim’,
in a number of the ICANN–ccTLD Exchanges of Letters.45 One could say
that in such cases subsidiarity applies in lieu of a formal agreement with
ICANN.
Although the management of a ccTLD is in the hands of the respective
ccTLD manager, registrations in the second level and other levels further
from the TLD are managed on lines similar to that of second-level gTLDs,
that is, through agreements between the ccTLD registry and registrars, with
the latter assisting registrants in the registration of their domain names.
However, in the case of ccTLDs, there is no system of ICANN accreditation
of registrars. It is normally the respective ccTLD registry which accredits its
registrars. Moreover, as explained above, the role of contracts here is more
modest than it is in the regulation of the gTLD namespace.46 In effect, the
management of the country-code namespace is in the hands of the ccTLD
manager, in the spirit of the principle of subsidiarity abovementioned. Some

ccTLDs have a rather liberal policy with the types of domain names regis-
tered, and with regards to who is allowed to register a domain name (eg

Austria). Other ccTLDs are more restrictive in their policy. Thus, for ex-
ample, to register a domain name under .no, a business must first be regis-
tered in the register of business entities in Norway, whereas a private

individual may only be registered under the priv.no domain provided he
or she is 18 years or older and has a Norwegian identity number.47
Some ccTLD regimes have a statutory footing. Thus, for example,
Norway’s Domain Name Regulations,48 issued under the authority of the
Electronic Communications Law,49 establish the role of the registry (Norid)
and registrars and requires that an applicant for a domain name signs a
declaration confirming certain facts (eg that the domain name is not in

opted to refer to the GAC principles and guidelines in toto. 46 See also Bygrave (n 11) 180. 47 See further <http://www.norid.no/domeneregistrering/registrere.en.html>. See also Bygrave and

THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF ICANN AND THE DNS

breach of the law, does not infringe third-party rights, etc) It also sets up an
ADR committee to hear domain name disputes. Anyone wanting to register
a domain name in Norway has to apply via one of Norid’s approved list of .no
registrars.
Just before the opening of the gTLD namespace under the new gTLD
program, there were by far fewer gTLDs50 than ccTLDs.51 With the opening
of the new gTLD namespace, this situation will be reversed. From holding a
considerable portion of the DNS, ccTLD managers will hold a minority of
the whole domain namespace. Whether this will indeed strengthen ICANN’s
position and regulatory clout will likely depend on the extent to which the
ccTLD managers, in the event of a divergence of opinion with ICANN, have
effective backing from their respective state as well as from the advisory
committee representing the states within ICANN—the Governmental
Advisory Committee (GAC). It may also lead to contract becoming the
main regulatory tool of the whole DNS with, of course, the consequence
that ICANN will play a more dominant role as the common and constant
contractual partner in any such eventual regulatory framework.
4. Hybrid net
4.1 – Complexity of the legal landscape

The previous two sections of this article analysed the various regulatory in-
struments underlying ICANN and the DNS. The next issue to consider is

whether and how these different types of instruments may co-exist and inter-
relate as a coherent regulatory framework.

What is immediately obvious is the complexity of the regulatory frame-
work, both with regards to the types of regulatory mechanisms used—ran-
ging from hard to ‘soft’ law—as well as in the sheer quantity of mechanisms

used. Both ICANN and the DNS are examples of intricate network structures
composed of a variety of ‘hybrid’ elements. The notion of hybridity is useful
to elucidate the complexities of elaborate networks. The term ‘hybrid’ ‘is a
combination of a contradictory difference, marked not by either/or, but by
both-and. It is this both-and that will guide the search for new tendencies in
law and society’.52 Hybrids are ‘the combination of both sides of [a]
difference’.53

50 As at March 2013, there were 22 gTLDs. 51 An updated list of ccTLDs is available at <http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db>. As at 9 October
2013, there are 250 ccTLDs in ASCII. 52 I-J Sand, ‘Hybrid law – Law in a global society of differentiation and change’ in Festschrift fu ̈r Gunther Teubner

The mechanisms used may be grouped under the following regulatory
types:
(i) private law regulation
(ii) public law regulation
(iii) private–public arrangements
(iv) self-regulation
(v) technical code or lex informatica
A further dimension to the above list is the international element, namely
‘private international law’ since in some cases different national laws may be
applicable.
As mentioned earlier, ‘private law regulation’54 is predominant in the
legal basis of ICANN as well as in the gTLD namespace where a complex

web of contracts is used between ICANN, the registries, registrars and third-
party escrow agents. Contracts and less formal55 private law mechanisms are

also used, though to a lesser degree, in the regulation of the ccTLD name-
space as between registries and registrars.

‘Public law’ also plays a significant role, both in the vexed question of the
role of the US government, through the DOC, in ICANN and hence its
influence on internet governance, as well as in the role of the national

authorities56 in the governance of the DNS. The AOC shows a gradual di-
minishing of influence of the DOC and has been described as having more a

political than contractual importance.57 Nevertheless, the requirement in
the AOC and IANA contracts for ICANN’s physical presence in the USA as
well as that its primary operations are to be in the USA is significant. As
discussed earlier, it anchors ICANN physically in the territory of the USA,
potentially vesting the USA with jurisdictional and enforcement powers well
beyond the subject-matter of these three agreements.58 Coupled with the
DOC’s role in auditing and approving any changes in the root file zone that
IANA makes, this further evidences US political oversight of ICANN.59
Another observation that can be made about the complexity of these
networks is with regards to the ‘private-public overtones’. Though ICANN
54 By ‘private law regulation’ is meant regulation that is voluntarily agreed to by private actors, the most
common example of which is contract. 55 See section 3.3 on exchanges of letters and Accountability Frameworks. 56 See further section 3.3. 57 See Froomkin (n 9) 223. 58 There have been instances of domain name seizures by the US Department of Homeland Security, eg the
seizure of www.rojadirecta.com though that site had previously been found to be operating legally by Spanish
courts—<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/02/rojadirecta-org-seized_n_817458.html>. Through
its IANA function, ICANN is responsible for the root zone management of the DNS. Verisign Inc., also
based in the USA, is the root zone maintainer. A domain name seizure warrant issued by any US court may
thus be easily enforced on Verisign Inc as the root zone maintainer as well as the registrar of some of the most

popular TLDs like .com. Likewise, ICANN’s physical presence in the USA also brings it within easy enforce-
ment reach of US authorities. 59See also M Mueller, Networks and States: The Global Politics of Internet Governance (MIT Press 2010) 63.

THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF ICANN AND THE DNS

is set up as a private law organization, it originated in the public call made by
the US DOC in the White Paper for a new corporate entity to take over
primary responsibility for managing the DNS.60 ICANN’s contract with the
DOC with respect to the IANA functions and the AOC are other facets of the

private–public character of the ICANN–DOC relationship. This type of com-
plexity may also be seen in the regulatory framework of the DNS at the

national level in those countries where the state has set up a private entity
to govern its ccTLD namespace, while at the same time retaining some sort
of stake in that private entity. Thus, for example, the administration of the

.no namespace is in the hands of UNINETT Norid AS, a non-profit share-
holder company owned by the Norwegian state.61

The regulation of the DNS is not just through legally binding norms.
Technical actors use computer code as the technical backbone of cyberspace
(lex informatica).62 Much of the technical rules underlying the technical
structure and function of the internet are extra-legal in the form of policy,

internet standards, best current practices and other ‘self-regulatory mech-
anisms’.63 As Sand explains, ‘[t]he concept of soft law has been produced by

both public and private law in formulating more or less specific guidelines,
but with an unclear legal status’.64 Some authors claim that such instruments
are not law but ‘only a social notion close to law’65 but others argue that they
‘are nevertheless commonly seen as a type of law... because they are aimed

at and capable of having some practical effect on conduct’.66 Arnaud de-
scribes the soft law phenomenon as infra-droit (literally ‘below law’) and

holds that what is not law in the strict sense nevertheless participates in
the legal phenomenon lato sensu.
67

Further complexity may arise from the potential application of different
national laws to similar facts due to the operation of ‘private international
law’. Thus, for example, in the case of gTLD registrars not based in the USA,
it is normally up to the registry to determine its dispute-resolution policy with
such registrars, although most registries opt for their country of registration
as venue.68 In practice, this means that a number of courts in different
countries can technically have jurisdiction to determine disputes between

Formulation of Information Policy Rules Through Technology’, (1998) 76 Tex L Rev 553. 63 See Bygrave (n 11) 171. In general, ‘self-regulation’ is taken to mean a private norm created by private
groups who have ‘rule-making capacities and the means to induce or coerce compliance’ See SF Moore, ‘Law

non-US gTLD registries and registrars, with the possibility that different laws
might be applied by such courts as the applicable law with respect to the
dispute, leading to potentially different or even contradictory outcomes.
The same observation may be made with regards to the complex dispute
resolution and choice-of-law clauses in the ccTLD ICANN-RAs.69
This variety and mishmash of legal and extra-legal regulatory mechanisms
is typical of hybrids and networks. This is because:
[n]etworks position themselves between law and non-law, profiting from

the symbolic association with law, but without inflexible legally forma-
lized positions.70

4.2 – Utility of looking at networks as hybrids
ICANN is a mixed network with elements from both private and public law
permeating its constitution. Hybridity is a tool to help one analyse and
understand the limits of traditional legal categories and descriptions with
a view to trying to find ways to understand and, if possible, reconcile any
contradictions that result from such categorization, or from the overlapping
of such categories.
Teubner draws a distinction between private networks71 and private–
public networks. Private networks usually exhibit a paradox as a result of
what he calls a ‘double bind’ which arises because of the contradictory line of

action a network node could take: either acting to safeguard its own indi-
vidual ‘selfish’ interests or to safeguard the interest of the collective. This

gives rise to what Teubner calls ‘double attribution’. This means that ‘[o]ne
and the same economic transaction is attributed twice, to the individual
actor as the node in the network and to the overarching network itself’.72

Such contradictions arise because networks are a unitas multiplex—a collect-
ive of multiple individual actors.73 Though the individual actors or stake-
holders in the network also pursue their own interest, they also pursue a

common interest with the other network parties to realise the overarching
network purpose. Tensions may arise, for example, between self-interest as
an autonomous actor and between the interests of the collective, for

European Community are to be judged according to the laws of Belgium, whereas the acts of ICANN shall

Agreements. 70 Sand (n 52) 874. 71 See G Teubner, Networks as Connected Contracts (ed with Introduction by H Collins, M Everson tr, Hart

THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF ICANN AND THE DNS

example, between the role of a registrar vis-a`-vis the other registrars and its
registry; or between the role of a registry vis-a`-vis the other registries and
ICANN.
The complexity is magnified in the case of mixed networks such as ICANN
where there are private–public cooperative arrangements. The ‘double
bind’ of private networks turns into a ‘multiple bind’. The conflicts that
arise are normally not just because of ‘the conflict between collective and
individual action. Rather it is the conflict of different rationalities in society
which drives the private-public arrangements into confusion’.74

These different rationalities are evidenced in the unique multi-stake-
holder structure of ICANN which is made up of representatives of different

‘constituencies’ or ‘stakeholder groups’, often with varying or even conflict-
ing interests. These stakeholder groups comprise the private and public

sectors, the technical community, the business community, non-commercial
users, civil society and the GAC. It may happen that, on a particular issue
relating to internet governance, there is a divergence of opinion between the
stakeholders. This is normally sought to be resolved by compromise through
the operation of the multi-stakeholder process.75 ICANN thus attempts in its
structure to provide a balanced representation of these different stakeholder

groups by giving them a voice in its Board where all decision-making author-
ity rests.76 The Board is tasked to fulfil, observe and uphold ICANN’s com-
mitments in the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and AOC, all of which

documents invoke the public interest as a guiding principle. The Board

does, nevertheless, also have the power to amend its own Bylaws by a two-
thirds majority vote.77

Moreover, ICANN’s processes are open, bottom-up and consensus-based,
drawing on norms derived from internet standards organizations such as the
IETF.78 One of the most important supporting organizations tasked with the
development of policy has itself a multi-stakeholder structure, namely the
GNSO which is responsible for the policy development process (PDP) with

regards to the gTLD. The GNSO comprises members from both stake-
holders that have a contractual relationship with ICANN (ie registries and

registrars) as well as non-contractual stakeholders (comprising commercial
stakeholders like intellectual property holders, internet service providers
74 Teubner (n 72) 18. 75 Where agreement by all stakeholders cannot be reached, the majority view is taken, with room for the

dissenting stakeholders to record their dissent. See eg the dissenting position of the representatives of the Non-
Commercial Stakeholder Group with response thereto from the At-Large Advisory Committee representative

in the Advice to the ICANN Board submitted by the Consumer Trust Working Group regarding the definitions,
measures and targets for competition, consumer trust and consumer choice (version 4 dated 5 December 2012
(Appendix D)). 76 M Mueller, ‘ICANN, Inc.: Accountability and participation in the governance of critical internet resources’
(2009), retrieved from the Internet Governance Project website <http://www.internetgovernance.org/pdf/
ICANNInc.pdf>. 77 See Bylaws art XIX. 78 In art 4 of the AOC, the DOC affirms ‘its commitment to a multi-stakeholder, private sector led, bottom-up
policy development model for DNS technical coordination that acts for the benefit of global Internet users.’

and non-commercial stakeholder groups). So even at the micro level of an

important stakeholder organization like the GNSO, room is given for differ-
ent voices with vying interests to be heard. The PDP is described in ICANN’s

own Bylaws.
One may thus observe a system of checks and balances within the structure
of ICANN and the PDP which, if properly observed, provides a balanced

representation of the various interests in internet governance. The above-
mentioned basic documents underlying ICANN’s structure and processes79

have undertones of a state constitution, especially when seen together with
the other regulatory instruments underlying ICANN and its management of
the DNS.80 A characteristic of mixed networks is that ‘a broader public law
concept of a network constitution is required which would indeed transfer
principles of institutional autonomy, constitutional rights, due process, rule
of law, public accountability to these mixed private-public configurations’.81
It is also in light of these public law—indeed constitutional law—elements
that ICANN’s role and function should be interpreted and understood.
5. Mesh
The focus of this article now turns to the question of how these different
types of legal instruments, which are so different in nature and made with
different legal actors, relate together. How are they to be read and applied
together so that there is coherence in this legal framework? As mentioned
earlier, ICANN has been described as a ‘self-constitutionalizing’ body.82
Both its formal organization as a private law foundation and the instruments
canvassing its external relations with the abovementioned actors are part of

its constitutional framework. They are the ‘constitutive’ documents of, re-
spectively, ICANN and the DNS and are, so to speak, their legal sources. An

analogy may be drawn with how the various sources of law operate within a
state’s legal system.
As Ost and van de Kerchove explain, the traditional approach in law has
been to look at regulation and law-making authority as being in the form of a

pyramid with the state at the top as the supreme legislator in both the in-
ternal legal order and international relations with other sovereign states.

This is Kelsen, Hart and Ross’s view of a political and legal order centred
round the state.83 In this tradition, the sources of law have a hierarchical
structure in a state’s internal system with, generally speaking, the state’s
constitution or similar basic law ranking topmost, followed by statute, in
turn followed by delegated legislation. Depending on the legal system and

THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF ICANN AND THE DNS

tradition, court judgments may have the binding force of law (eg English
common law) or merely a persuasive value (eg several civil law systems).
Within this hierarchy of legal sources one also finds customary law as well
as contracts and other self-regulatory instruments.
The previous sections of this article show the well-nigh impossibility of
applying this traditional view to the regulation of ICANN and the DNS.
There is no supreme sovereign-making power, no rigid clear-cut territorial
delimitations of a state where that sovereign rules. ICANN has not been set
up under Treaty law, although its function and role are of international
significance in that it manages unique and critical resources of worldwide
importance.
In their seminal work on network or ‘mesh’ regulation, Ost and van de
Kerchove perceive a paradigm shift caused by the profound transformation
of the state and of modern law. The world, since Kelsen, Hart and Ross were

writing, has changed with the advent of globalization of the financial mar-
kets, the growing interdependence of economies, the developments in in-
formation and communication technologies, the advent and ubiquity of the

internet, the appearance of powerful private transnational organizations,
the rise in importance of human rights and the weakening power of the
state to take action.84
This paradigm shift led to what Ost and van de Kerchove call a crisis of the

pyramidal model of regulation.85 It led them to propound that a rival para-
digm has been progressively emerging—that of the network (re ́seau) model

of regulation, albeit with important remnants of the pyramidal model per-
sisting.86They explain that with network regulation, the state ceases to be the

sole source of sovereignty (having to share this not just with super-state
authorities but also with powerful private entities); the will of the legislator
ceases to be received as dogma (it is accepted only subject to conditions, after
a complex evaluation process both ahead and after the enactment of a law);
the borders between fact and law at times become blurred; the different
powers of the state interact (judges become co-authors of the law and the

sub-delegation of normative power which, in principle was prohibited, multi-
plies); the juridical systems (and, more broadly, the normative systems)

become entangled; knowledge of the law which traditionally proclaimed

its methodological purity (mono-disciplinary) now leans towards an inter-
disciplinary mode and is more the result of a learning process than a priori

axioms.87 Moreover, justice, which in the pyramidal model was reduced to
the hierarchies of values fixed in the law, is today understood in terms of the
balance of interests and the equilibration of values which are both different
and variable.88

The starting point and focus of Ost and van de Kerchove’s mesh theory of
regulation is the state’s legal system, namely the effect of globalization and
internationalization on a state’s ‘internal’ legal order and the interplay of law
and other forms of regulation within that state’s legal system. They illustrate
this by looking at the impact of European Union (EU) law on Member States

and describe the EU’s extensive law-making powers as a ‘progressive intru-
sion in the national legal system’.89 One way in which the potential tension

between EU law and national law is resolved is through the principle of
subsidiarity, whereby action is taken at an EU level ‘only if and in so far as
the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the
Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the
proposed action, be better achieved by the Community’.90
ICANN’s role in the management of the DNS has also sometimes led to

tensions with individual states. Though ICANN is a very different legal crea-
ture to the EU, states have also had to come to some arrangement with

ICANN with regards to the regulation of the ccTLD namespace and, as
seen in Section 3.3, most ccTLD managers have also embraced a subsidiarity
principle.
This article seeks to extend the application of mesh theory to ICANN, a
private organization with international reach though not a creature of

Treaty law, and its management of the DNS. This article thus takes a differ-
ent starting point than that taken by Ost and van de Kerchove which has the

state and its regulatory framework as its focus.

Ost and van de Kerchove explain that the move towards network regula-
tion is the result of two major transformations of the legal and political

landscape: (i) the move from the use of statute as the primary instrument
of control within a state to other forms of ‘regulation’ such as self-regulation

and (ii) the increased use of the notion of ‘governance’ instead of govern-
ment.91 As regards the first transformation, the unilateral, authoritarian,

centralized and sovereign authority is giving way to a flexible, decentralized,

adaptive and often negotiated regulation. The second transformation is re-
flected in the increased popularity of the notion of ‘governance’ in lieu of

‘government’. Government is ‘the conduct of affairs attached to the sover-
eign state, the imposition of the rules by a public and central authority’.92

Governance, explain Ost and van de Kerchove, is ‘a process of co-ordination
of actors, of social groups, which are not all attached to the state, nor

89 EU legislation has direct effect on Eumember states. ibid 65. 90 See art 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union. Another mechanism is the doctrine of the supremacy of
EU law over national law. See further (n 5) 66–68. 91 See Ost and van de Kerchove (n 5) 26–32. 92 See ibid 29 who cite J Comaille and B Jobert, ‘Introduction. La regulation politique: l’e ́mergence d’un
nouveau regime de conaissance’ in Comaille and Jobert (eds), Les me ́tamorphoses de la re ́gulation politique (LGDJ

state-owned, to attain the aims which have been properly discussed and
collectively defined in fragmented and uncertain environments’.93
Other scholars have also discerned ‘the contemporary experience of the
collapse of hierarchical and centralised notions of law and, on the other, an

understanding of the limited and formal possibilities of established jurispru-
dential approaches in accounting for this experience’.94 The Finnish project

on polycentricity argues for a polycentric account of the law which thinks not
only within the traditional boundaries of the law, but also along the limits of

what the law is traditionally seen as ‘not’ being, for example, ‘ethics, moral-
ity, politics, religion or economics, and, further, values, emotions or experi-
ences’.95 These different positions from which the law may be taught are

‘polycentres’ or ‘the ‘multiple stages on which law is set to play its act’.96 One
effect of this approach is the ‘destabilisation of law from a single centre stage
into the innumerable stages of polycentricity [which] also sets the alleged
identity and coherence of law into play’.97
The focus, therefore, cannot just be on the activities of the lawmaker. As
Reed puts it ‘[s]ocial norms reflect the consensus of a community about how
its members should behave, and those norms which are given the status of
law are developed at least as much by the community as by the lawmaker’.98

Murray calls this ‘network communitarianism’ and sees regulation as ‘a pro-
cess of discourse and dialogue between the individual and society’.99 This is

evidenced in the multi-stakeholder structure of ICANN as discussed in the
previous section.
The use of a pyramid as a graphical description is popular in regulatory

discourse. In examining different enforcement mechanisms of state regula-
tory bodies, Ayres and Braithwaite proposed a pyramid showing different

enforcement strategies with mild self-regulatory measures at the bottom and
gradually more stringent enforcement measures as one progresses towards

the top of the pyramid.100 However, their pyramid reflected only the regu-
latory action of one actor: the state. Grabosky extended Ayres and

Braithwaite’s model by proposing a three-dimensional pyramid which, be-
sides state regulatory action, also takes into account two other institutions

which comprise a regulatory system: (i) regulated entities themselves and

their industry associations; and (ii) third parties, both public interest insti-
tutions and commercial actors.101

The use of such pyramids by Ayres, Braithwaite, Grabosky and other scho-
lars102 of the ‘responsive regulation’ school of thought is to illustrate the

escalating levels of enforcement strategies that are available. The higher its
location in the pyramid, the more coercive is the regulatory instrument. All

of the various enforcement mechanisms, whatever their level, play an im-
portant enforcement role. Indeed, the use of levels within the pyramid is not

meant to give the impression that the closer a level is to the apex, the more
effective that enforcement strategy is. Ayres and Braithwaite themselves note
the paradox that extremely stringent regulatory laws may sometimes cause
underregulation.103 Thus, for example, withdrawing a license—which is at
the apex of the enforcement pyramid—though effective, would be drastic
and ‘morally unacceptable to use it with any but the most extraordinary
offenses’.104 In this sense, ‘[r]egulators do not have their greatest effects
by directly sanctioning law-breakers; more important is the indirect effect
of lending authoritative support to law-abiding constituencies within the
organization’.105
The mesh notion of regulation is a better descriptor of the regulatory
framework of ICANN and the DNS than Ayres and Braithwaite’s notion of
a pyramid. Ost and van de Kerchove’s concept of network regulation uses
the metaphor of a ‘network’ or ‘net’ which is weaved from a set of interlinked
yarns and comprises threads and nodes where the threads interlink.106 Some
authors also refer to it as ‘mesh regulation’, using a similar metaphor of ‘the
steel mesh in reinforced concrete structures or the mesh in fishing nets

where, when put together different strands provide a structure much stron-
ger than that of the individual components’.107 In the mesh model, ‘[t]he

origin of the strands, whether from self-regulation or state regulation is im-
material: what is important is the flexibility and strength of the structure

provided’.108 The mesh regulatory model comprises regulatory efforts by
state and non-state actors alike, and includes various types of regulatory
mechanisms including computer code.
Schultz also attempts to apply Ost and van de Kerchove’s mesh regulation

to internet regulation. Schultz sees three main categories of actors in cyber-
space: states, technical actors and users.109 He holds that each of these actors

is the source of a normative flow (un flux normative): (i) states regulate
through legislation; (ii) technical actors use computer code as the technical
backbone of cyberspace (lex informatica) and (iii) users regulate behaviour
through self-regulation. Schultz thus sees three principal sources of norms

THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF ICANN AND THE DNS

in cyberspace: statute, lex informatica and self-regulation.110 Each of these
different actors pursues different objectives and defends divergent interests.
This means, he claims, that in many cases, this interaction becomes a contest,
with each actor jostling to impose its norms, leading to a confrontation or
collision of the normative flow which each actor is seeking to impose.111 The
rivalry between these models of regulation means that one can hardly know a
priori which model will govern a certain issue in cyberspace. Schultz holds
that each actor will expect to impose its model and the probability of an actor
of achieving that varies from one domain to another, from one problem to
another.112

Schultz’s thesis of there being three main categories of actors in cyber-
space, each of which pushes for the use of one of three separate models of

regulation is alluring. Yet I hold that this picture is incomplete and simplis-
tic. We have seen that there are numerous actors in cyberspace. Indeed, one

of Schultz’s categories—users—can itself be split into various categories,
each of which is important enough in its own right to be deemed another
category and not a sub-category, namely business actors, non-commercial
actors and even, more broadly, civil society or ‘the Internet community’ as
ICANN’s Articles of Incorporation calls them.113 More importantly, it can
happen that one group of these ‘users’ (eg business users) has conflicting
interests to those in another group of ‘users’ (eg non-commercial users).
Indeed, conflicts may also arise among various types of business users, for
example, trademark holders and business registrants. Moreover, it is not
clear whether the term ‘self-regulation’114 used by Schultz includes contract
within it—in any case it is rather unfortunate that one cannot distinguish
between binding undertakings (contract) and other so-called ‘soft law’
mechanisms in Schultz’s thesis. Indeed, as we have seen above, actors may
not always want to opt for binding contractual rules but prefer ‘soft law’
mechanisms.
Another important point that Schultz’s simplified ‘mesh’ model overlooks
is that it is not always the case that an actor will opt to use the regulatory
model that Schultz pairs with that actor. Thus, for example, a state may not
always choose to legislate on an issue, preferring to go for co-regulation with
a particular branch of industry, or it may choose to enter into a private–
public agreement with another actor, or perhaps to opt for an informal,
non-binding arrangement. We have seen this in the various ways national
authorities have chosen to document their relationship with ICANN in their
(the state’s) management of their ccTLD.
Ost and van de Kerchove’s notion of mesh regulation does not have the
fetters of Schultz’s narrow ‘mesh’ model but encompasses the truly

internormative process115 that is evident in the regulation of ICANN and the
DNS. As we have seen, several different modes of regulation may be needed

to satisfactorily address a particular issue. In the context of internet regula-
tion this internormative process may be illustrated by examining how the .eu

domain was established. The creation of .eu first required a policy action by
the ICANN Board which led to the reservation of the two-letters ‘eu’ as the

country code for the European Union in ISO 3166-1. Following the desig-
nation of EURid as its ccTLD register, through a process of EU legislation,116

ICANN/IANA delegated .eu as a ccTLD to EURid through the .eu RA. In

this illustration, at least three different normative models were used: a policy-
development process to amend an ISO standard, various EU legislation to

select and set out the terms of reference of the registry and a contract for the
delegation of the .eu domain. Each of these three regulatory mechanisms
played an equally important role in this process.
6. Conclusion
The various regulatory mechanisms discussed in this article—whether

formal or informal, ‘hard’ or ‘soft’, legal or computer code, statute or self-
regulation—provide alternative and complementary regulatory devices for

ICANN and the DNS. While lex informatica, self-regulation and state regula-
tion intertwine and reciprocally complement each other’s rules and pro-
cesses, each one ‘retains its identity and regulatory strengths’.117 Indeed,

the usefulness of mesh theory as applied to these hybrid networks is the
insight that the relative importance and authority of each source of rule
‘is greater or lesser according to the nature of the activity and the other

participants being regulated’.118 Though not free from controversy, in par-
ticular due to the considerable oversight powers of the USA, the result of this

tapestried and hybrid regulatory framework has been a relatively stable
framework for DNS governance.

115 On internormativity, see Carbonnier’s definition in Dictionnaire Encyclope ́dique de The ́orie et de Sociologie du
Droit (n 67). 116 Regulation 733/2002 of 22 April 2002 on the implementation of the .eu Top Level Domain laid down
how the eventual entity to run the .eu registry would be chosen, its obligations and the policy framework for this
domain. EURid was formally set up under Belgian law as a private, not-for-profit organization on 8 April 2003
and was subsequently designated .eu registry through Decision 2003/375/EC. Subsequently, regulation 874/
2004 of 28 April 2004 set out in greater detail the public policy rules concerning the implementation and
functions of the .eu TLD such as the accreditation of registrars by the registry, applications for second-level
domain names, and an ADR procedure to settle domain name disputes. 117 JP Mifsud Bonnici (n 107) 230. 118 ibid.
